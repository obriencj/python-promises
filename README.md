# Overview of python-promises

A python module providing container and proxy promises, supporting
linear and multi-processing deliver.

I really recommend that you don't use this, so long as this warning
exists in the README. I'm just playing around with the features. Also
I wrote a lot of this while sick with the Flu.

See TODO for more information on where this is going.
